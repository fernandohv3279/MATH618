Back to Mark's article

"We know a great deal more about the forces which produce the vibrations
 of sound than about those which produce the vibrations of light. To find
 out the different tunes sent out by a vibrating system is a problem which
 may or may not be solvable in certain special cases, but it would baffle
 the most skillful mathematician to solve the inverse problem and to find
 out the shape of a bell by means of the sounds which it is cable of
 sending out."
 -Arthur Schuster, 1882.
