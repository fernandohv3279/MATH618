Can one hear
the shape of
a drum?

Mark Kac (1966)

Simpler question

Can one hear
the length
of a string?

Intuitively

Mathematically

Let F(x,t) be the vertical displacement
of the string at position x and time t


∂²F/∂t²=c²∂²F/∂x²

∂²F/∂t²=∂²F/∂x²

F(x,t)=g(x)h(t)

g''(x)/g(x)=h''(t)/h(t)

g''(x)/g(x)=h''(t)/h(t)=𝝺

g''(x)/g(x)=h''(t)/h(t)=-𝝺

g''(x)=-𝝺g(x)
h''(t)=-𝝺h(t)

g''(x)=-𝝺g(x)
+ Dirichlet BC

g(x)=Asin(√𝝺 x)

𝝺=n²𝝿²/L²
for n=1,2,3,...

h''(t)=-𝝺h(t)

h(t)=Bcos(√𝝺 t) + Csin(√𝝺 t)

Remember F(x,t)=g(x)h(t)

Frequencies at which the
string can vibrate are
√𝝺/2𝝿=n/2L for n=1,2,3,...

Answer: yes!

Can one hear
the shape of
a drum?

∂²F/∂t²=∆F

...

∆g(x,y)=-𝝺g(x,y)
h''(t)=-𝝺h(t)

Answer: maybe

What can we hear?

Area

Perimeter

One can hear
circles!

P²≥4𝝿A

Next step

Can one hear
the shape of
a manifold?
